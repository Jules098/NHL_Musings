### Winning Percentages and Points Percentages

Since the COVID-19 season in 2020-21, team strength based on division has been a topic of conversation that has permeated through hockey discourse.  In the 2020-21 season, it made sense to talk about, as teams were essentially divided between 4 separate leagues, never playing across divisional lines.  But since then, with each team playing every other team at least twice (up to a maximum of 4 times for a few divisional rivals), the argument has lost its luster for me.

Below is the current average winning percentages against each division:

The Atlantic division has the lowest average winning percentage, meaning the average record against Atlantic division opponent's has less wins than the other divisions.  The Pacific division has the highest average winning percentage, meaning the average record against Pacific division teams are higher than the other divisions.

Switching to points percentages doesn't change the overall picture much:

The Metropolitan division ends up with the lowest average points % against, with the Pacific division coming out with the highest average points percentage against.

Below we can see a breakdown of each teams wins per division:
